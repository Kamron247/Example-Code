"""
This code snippet is a part of course work i did.
The course work was creating a rideshare app.

More specifically, we created a database to handle users, rides, 
and the many other things you would need for such an app.

This code snippet connects the database to a callable API.
Which were unit tested in a separate python file.

This specific snippet of the code was just for user information api
